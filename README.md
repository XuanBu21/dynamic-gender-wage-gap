# Dynamic Visualization for Gender Wage Gap

This repo is for the project of the dynamic visualizations of the gender wage gap (in the US and accross the world).



# Reference:
The codes of building the sidebar and combining text and charts are heavily based on the codes from the "slide-show" workshop by Andrew McNutt, the professor of the course CAPP 30239 Data Visualization for Public Policy.

The codes of making the line chart (lineChart function from ./src/app.js) are inspired by several D3 tutorial sources:
- D3 Graph Gallery, "Line plot with dropdown to filter group in d3.js", https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_filter.html
- D3 Graph Gallery, "Line plot with several groups", https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_several_group.html
- Jill, Hubleyâ€™s Block, 2016, "line chart with dropdown selector", http://bl.ocks.org/jhubley/17aa30fd98eb0cc7072f
- Amber, Thomas' Block, 2017, "Nesting and Accessing Data in D3v4", https://amber.rbind.io/2017/05/02/nesting/

The raw data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm
