# Dynamic Visualization for Gender Wage Gap

This repo is for the project of the dynamic visualizations of the gender wage gap (in the US and accross the world).



# Reference:
The codes of building the sidebar and combining text and charts are heavily based on the codes from the "slide-show" workshop by Andrew McNutt, the professor of the course CAPP 30239 Data Visualization for Public Policy.

The codes of making the line chart (./src/line-chart.js) are inspired by the following D3 tutorial sources:
1. D3 Graph Gallery, "Line plot with dropdown to filter group in d3.js", https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_filter.html
2. D3 Graph Gallery, "Line plot with several groups", https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_several_group.html
