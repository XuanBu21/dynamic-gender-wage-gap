    "Gender Earning Ratio across the USA": "Gender wage gap is a public issue of widespread concerns over the past decades. For a long time, numerous policy-makers have devoted to narrowing the gender wage gap. After all these efforts, has the gap been narrowed? To help answering the question, we display the trend of ER from 1979 to 2018 in the US using line chart in the right interactive graph. To better measure the gap, we use earnings ratio (ER) (female-to-male median yearly earning) to represent the gender wage gap. The higher the ER, the smaller the gender wage gap. There are three more categories (age, education and race) that can be selected so as to better explore the data. Use the select box to switch the category of interest. Meanwhile, in each category, there are interactive legends and lines. Moving the cursor to the subgroup of interest in the legend would show the relevant ER trend line in the graph.",
    "Gender Earning Ratio over the World": "This part is for the dynamic visualization of the comparison of gender wage gap corresponding with the gross national income (GNI) US dollars/capita among OCED coutries (mostly developed countries)."
