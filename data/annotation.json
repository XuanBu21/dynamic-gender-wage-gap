    "Gender Earning Ratio across the USA": "Gender wage gap is a public issue of widespread concerns over the past decades. For a long time, numerous policy-makers have devoted to narrowing the gender wage gap. After all these efforts, has the gap been narrowed? To help answering the question, we display the trend of ER from 1979 to 2018 in the US using line chart in the right interactive graph. To better measure the gap, we use earnings ratio (ER) (female-to-male median yearly earning) to represent the gender wage gap. The higher the ER, the smaller the gender wage gap. There are three more categories (age, education and race) that can be selected so as to better explore the data. Use the select box to switch the category of interest. Meanwhile, in each category, there are interactive legends and lines. Moving the cursor to the subgroup of interest in the legend would show the relevant ER trend line in the graph.",
    "Gender Earning Ratio over the World": "In the right graph, we can dynamically compare the gender wage gaps among OECD countries (mostly developed countries) with their gross national income (GNI, US dollars per capita) in the past decades (1979 â€“ 2018). Moving the slider can dynamically display the trend of the comparison between the gender wage gap and GNI among these countries. And moving mouse over the legend of continents can explore the group of interest. To better compare the trend between the US and other countries, the US has been divided into a single group. Through this visualization, we can find the trend that points are moving from the top left to the right bottom. That is, as the GNI grows, the gender wage gaps of the OECD countries have been decreasing over years. For the US, the growth rate of GNI is higher than most countries, and the gender wage gap keeps decreasing but still higher than half of the OECD countries."
